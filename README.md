# Objective

Creates a long term short memory (LSTM) stock prediction model. LSTM is a form of the deep learning neural network model that is best suited to handle making prediction for time
series data. Given that stock data is a time series model this project aims to identify the effectiveness of LSTM models for predicting stock data. See the python notebokk for
the results.
